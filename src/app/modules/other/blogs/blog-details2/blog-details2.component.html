                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steel industry has been offline for decades. Information
                                        regarding
                                        delivery and inventory is scarce or often, incomplete.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purchase manager&rsquo;s list of steel supplier and
                                        distributors is
                                        limited. When undertaking a project, the executive has to source suppliers and
                                        involve in tedious,
                                        long drawn conversations with them. The choices are limited, processes are
                                        piling up and costs seem
                                        to increase everyday.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steel procurement then becomes a costly affair
                                        especially&nbsp; when many
                                        companies are looking to cut costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;By digitizing procurement, customers will be privy to a
                                        transparent, easy to access page which reduces the overdrawn processes of
                                        sourcing the right
                                        supplier for their business needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
