                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steel industry has been thriving for the last century,
                                        especially in the United States. So far in 2020, the domestic raw steel
                                        production was 1,383,000 net tons.</span><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To
                                        compete in the global scale, steel companies are adding value to their supply
                                        chain through digital transformation.</span></p>
                        <p><strong>Focusing on Value</strong></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry has remained predominantly offline through the
                                        ages. Even as information technology and automation swept across the world, the
                                        steel industry has retained its fairly conservative business model.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the increased competition, the industry is
                                        reconsidering this decades old strategy. They are looking to improve efficiency,
                                        reduce procurement costs and provide value to the end customer through superior
                                        quality and design.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><strong>Combating the costs of procurement</strong></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several forecasts postulate that the increasing price of raw
                                        materials like iron ore, coils, scrap among others will increase the
                                        manufacturing costs of suppliers. This in turn, will increase the cost price of
                                        steel, as suppliers strive to maintain their profit margins.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;By creating cost control techniques and operational
                                        efficiency, they might be able to maintain a steady profit margin. One of the
                                        primary ways to achieve that is by utilizing technology and digital
                                        transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By achieving efficiency in operations, these suppliers will
                                        be able to provide competitive pricing for the products, without compromising
                                        their profit margins.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US steel industry has been an indispensable part of the
                                        economy in the last century. As manufacturers and steel suppliers battle rising
                                        costs, volatile demand, increased competition and overcapacity, it is important
                                        to incorporate adequate technology in their operations in order to cut costs and
