            <p>The steel industry has functioned seamlessly for decades by following a traditional business model. This
                tried and tested approach has given rise to Tier one tier 2 suppliers and brokers leveraging their
                connections with each other and steel mills to procure the steel needs of the end customer. Customers
                had access to limited supplier pools, and the brokers will be the ones that source them out. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Our founder, Mr. Rajat Jain had been working in the steel industry for 8 years when he realized that the
                industry was in dire need of involvement of technology. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Thus began the inception of EOXS, an online steel marketplace which connects the supplier to the buyer.
                One of the leading marketplaces in USA and Canada, EOXS has managed to quickly climb up the ladder,
                procuring a $2 million seed money from Mucker Capital.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The purpose of EOXS is simple. We want to add value to every aspect of the steel industry. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>EOXS is currently valued at $6million and has been reporting net profits from the beginning, hitting
                their all time gross profit high of $600000 during the month of April. Our dynamic take on the steel
                industry is a reflection of Rajat, our CEO, who believes that its better to try and fail than fail to
                try.</p>
            <p> His experience in the industry made him understand the importance of technology in the marketplace,
                especially in a multi billion dollar steel industry like the USA. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>He started EOXS to make the business process better and with it, create a company culture that will have
                its own value. </p>
